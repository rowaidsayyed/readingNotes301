## Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript

### What is functional programming?

> Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

### pure functions
* It returns the same result if given the same arguments
* It does not cause any observable side effects

### Immutability
Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

### Referential transparency
if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.
'pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency'

## Functions as first-class entities
Functions as first-class entities can:
* refer to it from constants and variables
* pass it as a parameter to other functions
* return it as result from other functions

## Higher-order functions
* takes one or more functions as arguments, or
* returns a function as its result
