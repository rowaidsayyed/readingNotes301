## Javascript Templating
Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. 
### Template
The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.

### Mustache
Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. 
also Mustache is a specification for a templating language
It can be used for anything and here some examples
* HTML
* config files
* source code 

#### logic-les
because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead, there are only **tags**.
### mustache.js
* mustache.js is an implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript. 
* It is often considered the base for JavaScript templating.
* mustache supports various languages

we use two braces around the name '{{ name }}'. This is Mustache syntax to show that it is a **placeholder** and then replace '{{ name }}' with the actual value using '{ name: “rowaid” }'.

### Mustache-Express    
If you intend you use mustache with Node and Express, you can use mustache-express
