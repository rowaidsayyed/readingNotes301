## Database normalization
Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.

* table should be about a **specific** topic 
* By limiting a table to one purpose you reduce the number of duplicate data contained within your database. 

## Reasons for Database Normalization
There are three main reasons to normalize a database.
1. minimize duplicate data
2. minimize or avoid data modification issues
3. simplify queries. 

## Definition of Database Normalization
There are three common forms of database normalization: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd normal form. They are also abbreviated as 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF

* First Normal Form – The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.
* Second Normal Form – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.
* Third Normal Form – the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key
