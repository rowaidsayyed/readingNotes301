## JQuery
jQuery offers a simple way to achieve a variety of common
JavaScript tasks quickly and consistently

> JQuery is a javascript file that let us find elements using CSS selectors and then do something with the elements using jquery methods


In order to use jQuery, 
1. first thing you need to do is include the jQuery script in your page.
2. JavaScript file is included that uses jQuery selectors and methods to update the content of the HTML page.

### WHY USE JQUERY?
jQuery doesn't do anything you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript.but it makes coding simpler.
jQuery's motto is
>  "Write less, do more"

Using jQuery, you usually select elements using CSS-style selectors. It also offers some
extra selectors.

### matched set 
when select one or more elements a jquery object returned its known as a matched set or jquery selection

### set and get 
some jquery methods return and update the content of an element 

### Jquery references 
when creating jquery selection, jquery stores a reference to the corrosponding nodes in the DOM tree  

### checking a page 
checking a page is ready to work with we can use JQuery.ready method
'$(document).ready(function(){
// some code
});'
or the shortcut 
'$(function(){
// some code
});'

### Some JQuery methods
1. '.html()'

## Pair programming
Pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together. 
pair programming commonly involves two roles: 
1. Driver
2. Navigator

Pair programming touches on four skills:
1. Developers explain out loud what the code should do.
2. Developers listen to othersâ€™ guidance.
3. Developers read code that others have written.
4. Developers write code themselves.

Paired lab session benefits
1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
